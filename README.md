# Heyyo!

Thanks for dropping by.

I'm Greg, a developer from Columbus, OH.

## About Me
I've been programming since early 2010s, but didn't start my web development career until 2016. Besides some VBA macros and a super brief period programming bots in Diablo 3 using C#, my career is focused around web technologies. I work well autonomously and like to learn, experiment, play, build and break things.

Outside of work, I'm a gamer. I'm a cyclist with a goal to cycle 2,500 miles this year. I'm a glutton for good food and always in the mood to whip up a nice meal. I like to be outside hiking and hands-on in my garden. I like to travel and kitesurf when I can.

## What has my attention
**Crypto and DeFi** - As a programmer with a finance degree, the crypto and DeFi space has me hooked. Currently, I'm spending most of my free time diving into Ethereum, learning Solidity and testing out some alternative investments.

**Performance and monitoring** - At BLD, we implement SEO strategies to help our clients improve their rank in SERPs. Since Google will be incorporating performance metrics into their ranking, we've been busy making sure our client metrics are optimized and developing a product to help monitor and remediate their performance issues.

**Next.js** - I've been a bit frustrated with the GatsbyJS DX recently so I've been playing and migrating this website over to Next.js. I'm also pushing to build a static site product using Next.js at BLD for clients who need a simple, static solution for their website.
