# Heyyo!

Thanks for dropping by.

## What has my attention
- **Crypto and DeFi** - As a programmer with a finance degree, the crypto and DeFi space has me hooked. Currently, I'm spending most of my free time diving into Ethereum, learning Solidity and testing out some alternative investments.
- **Performance and monitoring** - At BLD, we implement SEO strategies to help our clients improve their rank in SERPs. Since Google will be incorporating performance metrics into their ranking, we've been busy making sure our client metrics are optimized and developing a product to help monitor and remediate their performance issues.
- **Next.js**
